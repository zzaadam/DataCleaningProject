# Objectives:
The primary objective was to clean and preprocess the Nashville Housing dataset to prepare it for further analysis and modeling. Specific goals included:
-Identifying and handling missing or inconsistent data in the dataset.
-Standardizing data formats and removing duplicates.
-Breaking out or combining columns to create more meaningful features.
-Removing irrelevant or redundant information.
-Preparing the cleaned dataset for subsequent analysis or modeling tasks.

# Methodology:
The data cleaning and preprocessing were performed using SQL, specifically Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). The following steps were taken:
-Data Exploration: The dataset was imported into SSMS, and the first 1,000 rows were previewed to understand the structure, data types, and potential issues within the data.
-Data Cleaning Techniques: Various SQL techniques were employed to clean and transform the data, including:
-Handling missing values using techniques like ISNULL(), COALESCE(), and NULLIF().
-Removing duplicates using window functions like ROW_NUMBER() and PARTITION BY.
-Standardizing date formats using CONVERT() and CAST().
-Breaking out address columns into separate columns (e.g., Address, City, State) using SUBSTRING() and PARSENAME().
-Updating and replacing values using CASE statements and UPDATE queries.
-Removing irrelevant columns or rows using SELECT and WHERE clauses.
-Use of Advanced SQL Concepts: The data cleaning process involved the use of advanced SQL concepts such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions (e.g., ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK()), joins, and aggregate functions.
-Creating Views and Storing Results: After cleaning and transforming the data, views were created to store the cleaned dataset for further analysis or modeling tasks.

# Conclusions:
Through the data cleaning and preprocessing of the Nashville Housing dataset, the following outcomes were achieved:
-Identification and handling of missing or inconsistent data, ensuring data quality and integrity.
-Standardization of data formats and removal of duplicates, improving data consistency and reliability.
-Creation of new, more meaningful features by breaking out or combining columns, facilitating better analysis and modeling.
-Removal of irrelevant or redundant information, reducing noise and improving the signal-to-noise ratio.
-Preparation of a cleaned and transformed dataset, ready for further analysis or modeling tasks, such as exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, or predictive modeling.
-The cleaned and preprocessed Nashville Housing dataset could be used by data analysts, researchers, or real estate professionals to gain insights, identify patterns, or develop predictive models related to the housing market in Nashville.
